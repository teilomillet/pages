  It's the place where I can write down idea's and where it should be continuity. As my ideas are mostly related to code, I find it normal and evident to keep them close.

  No intentionality rather than writting about code is in here. An exutoire that can live up to me. (Except if github erase profile or github.io)

  I feel it more like a social place for code, where I clearly state my ideas and intention and where my future (self) can dwelve into.

  Also it can be a place where I can comment on my code or code idea; while doing it. As a mind documentation in the process of building.

  I hope you will find what you are looking for or maybe more.
